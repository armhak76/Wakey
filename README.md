Wakey is my version of application which keeps your PC awake. It was inspired by Awake utility which was a part of Microsoft's PowerToys. It is written completely in C/C++ using Microsoft's WinUI library.

The stripped down (app) version is available on [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9N4SHVJ2WKGR?cid=DevShareMCLPCS)
