Wakey is my version of application which keeps your PC awake. It was inspired by Awake utility which was a part of Microsoft's PowerToys. It is written completely in C/C++ using Microsoft's WinUI library.

The stripped down (app) version is available on [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9N4SHVJ2WKGR?cid=DevShareMCLPCS), while full side load version is available here, on GitHub, in [Releases](https://github.com/gryph0n27/Wakey/releases) section. In order to install side loaded version, you need to add the included certificate to the "Trusted Root" section of the Local Machine first.
