Dear friend(s),

In response to "More information is required to review your request for using restricted capabilities: allowElevation, unvirtualizedResources". Both of these restricted capabilities are used when applications is sideloaded and not installed using Microsoft Store. "allowElevation" allows restarting application as and Administrator and allows writing to registry key ("unvirtualizedResources") under HKCU's "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\EnableGoodbye" key. The controls for doing so are hidden and disabled if application is not sideloaded. For sideloading, you can install the application from https://github.com/gryph0n27/Wakey, scrolling down to packages section on the right of the page.  I'm planning to publish source codes on the same GitHub page soon so you can ensure these capabilities are used only when app. is not installed from Microsoft store.
